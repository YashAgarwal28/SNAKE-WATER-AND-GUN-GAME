# SNAKE WATER AND GUN GAME

# Introduction:

Snake Water Gun Game is a simple yet entertaining Python program based on the popular childhood game often known as Rock-Paper-Scissors. This game is commonly used to make decisions between two parties but in a fun and random manner. The program allows users to play against the computer, which randomly selects one of the three options: snake, water, or gun.

# Features:

User Interaction: The program interacts with the user by prompting them to choose between snake, water, or gun.

Randomized Computer Selection: The computer randomly selects one of the three options: snake, water, or gun.

# Game Logic: The program determines the winner based on the game's rules:

- Snake drinks water (Snake wins)
- Water destroys gun (Water wins)
- Gun shoots snake (Gun wins)
# Score Tracking: The program keeps track of the user's score and displays it after each round.

# Multiple Rounds: The game allows users to play multiple rounds until they decide to quit.
